**Definition.** A *relation* between two sets is a subset of their [[Cartesian product]].

Usually special attention is given to relations *on* a set. There are some special properties that are studied:
**Reflex.** A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is *reflexive* if and only if $\ \forall a \in A, \ (a,a) \in R$.
**Symmetry.** A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is *symmetric* if and only if $\ \forall a,b \in A, \ (a,b) \in R \Rightarrow (b,a) \in R$.
**Transitivity.** A relation $R$ on a set $A$ is *transitive* if and only if $\ \forall a,b,c \in A, \ (a,b),(b,c) \in R \Rightarrow (a,c) \in R$.

A reflexive, symmetric, transitive relation is called an [[Equivalence]].
A class of relations chiefly characterised by transitive asymmetry is [[Order]].
A [[Function]] is another special type of relation.

Given a relation $R \subseteq A \times B$, the *complementary* relation of $R$ is $R ^c := (A\times B) \setminus R$.
