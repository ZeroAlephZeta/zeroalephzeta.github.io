A *subsequence* of a sequence is a subcollection of its terms with order preserved.
Given sequence $(x_n)$ and a strictly increasing sequence of naturals $(k_n)$, we define the corresponding subsequence $x_{k_n}$ as $x\circ k:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{R}$.
Subsequenes are in general normal sequences on their own, usually defined to filter into some specific properties of the main sequence.

The big theorem regarding subsequenes is the [[Bolzano-Weierstra√ü theorem]].
