>[!definition] Order topology
> Given any set $X$ with a strict total order $(<)$, with (not necessarily existent) minimum and maximum elements $a_{0},b_{0}\in X$ defined on it, we define a basis for a topology as $$  \mathcal{B}_{<}:=\{\ (x,y)\ |\ x,y\in X\ \}\cup \{\ [a_{0},y)\ |\ y\in X\ \} \cup \{\ (x,b_{0}]\ |\ x\in X\ \}. $$ The topology generated by $\mathcal{B}$ is called the *order topology* $\mathcal{T}_{<}$ on the ordered set $(X,<)$.

A trifle remains to show that the set defined here is indeed a basis. Also here the open interval notation is used in the conventional sense, that $(a,b)=\{x\in X\ |\ a<x<b  \}$.
>[!definition] Rays
> Given an ordered set $(X,<)$, the sets of the following four types are called *rays*:
> $$  \begin{cases} & (a,\infty):=\{ x\in X\ |\ a<x \} \\  & [a,\infty):=\{ x\in X \ |\ a≤x \} \\
 & (-\infty,b):=\{ x\in X \ |\ x<a \} \\  & (-\infty,b]:=\{ x\in X\ |\ x≤b \}\end{cases}  $$

>[!proposition] Subbasis for order topology
>We define a set of open rays $\mathcal{S}_{<}$ as follows: $$  \mathcal{S}_{<}:=\big\{ (-\infty,b)\ |\ b\in X \big\}\cup \big\{ (a,\infty)\ |\ a\in X \big\}  $$ and claim that this is a subbasis for the order topology on $(X,<)$.

>[!proof] 
> We need to show two things only: that $\bigcup \mathcal{S}_{<}=X$ and that $\mathcal{S}_{<}$ generates $\mathcal{B}_{<}$.
> Firstly notice that if $y<x$, then $(-\infty,y)\cup(x,\infty)=X$. So $\bigcup \mathcal{S}_{<}=X$.
> Then note that the last two sets in the basis union are made of open rays already. Also that any $(x,y)=(-\infty,y)\cup(x,\infty)$. Therefore by taking finite intersection we can generate $\mathcal{B}_{<}$ from $\mathcal{S}_{<}$. <p align="Right">$\blacksquare$</p>
