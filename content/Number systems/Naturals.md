$\mathbb{N} = \{1,2,3,\cdots \}$ 
There are several constructions of the naturals.
1. [[Peano axioms]]
2. [[von Neumann ordinals]]

Naturals have *addition*, *multiplication* and a total order defined on them. Next few propositions help solidify the naturals for common usage.

1. **Proposition.** Addition is commutative. $\forall m,n,\in\mathbb{N}, m+n=n+m$.
 *Proof.* 
2. **Proposition.** Addition is associative. $\forall m,n,p\in\mathbb{N}, {m+(n+p)=(m+n)+p}$.
 *Proof.* 
3. **Proposition.** Multiplication is commutative. $\forall m,n,\in\mathbb{N}, m\cdot n=n\cdot m$.
 *Proof.*
4. **Proposition.** Multiplication is associative. $\forall m,n,p\in\mathbb{N}, {m\cdot(n\cdot p)=(m\cdot n)\cdot p}$.
 *Proof.*
5. **Proposition.** Multiplication distributes over addition. $\forall m,n,p\in\mathbb{N}, \ {p\cdot(m+n)=(p\cdot m)+(p\cdot n)}$.
*Proof.* 

The naturals are Well-ordered by this order, as every subset of the $\mathbb{N}$ has a least elements. And the [[Principle of mathematical induction]] holds in $\mathbb{N}$; it holds according to the [[Peano axioms#^632bf5|axiom of induction]] and the other constructions follow these axioms.
