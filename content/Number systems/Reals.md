The reals $\mathbb{R}$ is the unique complete ordered field containing $\mathbb{Q}$. Every bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}$ has its respective [[Optimal bound]] in $\mathbb{R}$. Prior to the constructions, this above statement is taken as an axiom; the **axiom of completeness**. After the construction, it becomes a theorem.
###### Construction 
There are various constructions of it, with various philosophies. The major two are:
	1. [[Dedekind cuts]]
	2. [[Cauchy sequence classes]]
Notice how the former covers completeness much more easily but has trouble defining algebra whereas the latter has easy algebra but proving completeness is a nightmare. Regardless of the construction followed, the end product is a complete ordered field containing the rationals. Also, [[Archimedean principle]] is satisfied. Any further properties of the reals will be independent of the construction assumed.

For $A\subset\mathbb{R}$ bounded above, denote it's supremum by $\sup(A)\in\mathbb{R}$, and for $B\in\mathbb{R}$ bounded below, denote its infemum by $\inf(B)\in\mathbb{R}$.

Having these set in place, we are ready to begin *Analysis*. We first investigate sequences. For more of the structure of the reals, see Topology of the continuum.
