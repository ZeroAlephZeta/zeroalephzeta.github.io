>[!definition] Product topology
>Given topological spaces $(X,\mathcal{T}_{X})$ and $(Y,\mathcal{T}_{Y})$, we define the *product topology* $\mathcal{T}_{X\times Y}$ as one generated by the following basis: $\mathcal{B}:=\{ U\times V\ |\ U\in \mathcal{T}_{X},\ V\in \mathcal{T}_{V} \}$.

So we show that this indeed is a basis. This is done easily by noticing that $(U_{1}\times V_{1})\cap(U_{2}\times V_{2})=(U_{1}\cap U_{2})\times(V_{1}\cap V_{2})$
