>[!definition] Linearly independent subset
> $L=\{ v_{1},\dots,v_{m} \}\subset V$ is said to be *linearly independent* whenever $a_{1}v_{1}+\dots+a_{m}v_{m}=0\ \Longrightarrow\ a_{1}=\dots=a_{m}=0$. So $0$ has a unique representation in a linearly independent set of vectors. 
> Also by definition, $\varnothing$ is also considered linearly independent.

A set of vectors being linearly dependent is therefore just the negation of the condition in the definition above.
