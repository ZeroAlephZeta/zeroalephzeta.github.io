A *ring* $(R, + , *)$ is a set $R$ with binary operations $+$ and $*$ defined on it, following some axioms:
1. $(R,+)$ is an Abelian [[Group]] with identity $0$. 
2. $(R,*)$ is a [[Monoid]] with identity $1$.
3. **Distribution.** $\forall x,y,z \in R, \ x*(y+z)=(x*y)+(x*z)$ and $(x+y)*z = (x*z)+(y*z)$.
A ring with commutative multiplication ($*$) is called a Commutative [[Ring]].
