A *field* $(\mathbb{F}, + , *)$ is a set $R$ with binary operations $+$ and $*$ defined on it, following some axioms:
1. $(\mathbb{F}, +)$ is an Abelian [[Group]] with additive identity $0$.
2. $(\mathbb{F} \setminus \{0\},*)$ is an Abelian [[Group]] with multiplicative identity $1$. 
3. **Triviality.** $0 \neq 1$.
4. **Distribution.** $\forall x,y,z \in \mathbb{F}, \ x*(y+z)=(x*y)+(x*z)$ and $(x+y)*z = (x*z)+(y*z)$.
