Here we categorise the principal objects that we will be working with. 
Having developed set theory we now get ourselves some algebraic structures. After that we fit our number systems to the algebra we formed. We start with the [[Naturals]] $\mathbb{N}$ ($0 \notin \mathbb{N}$). Then we keep extending according to needs and whims to [[Integers]] $\mathbb{Z}$, then to [[Rationals]] $\mathbb{Q}$. We are pretty happy with that but something compels us to push forward to the [[Reals]] $\mathbb{R}$ and algebraic completeness is amalgamated into the reals to give rise to the [[Complex numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$. We stop there because that's more than enough numbers for analysis.
