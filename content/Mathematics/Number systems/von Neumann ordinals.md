This construction follows from axiomatic set theory where the natural numbers are treated as the fundamental major set in existence. From the **Axiom of infinity** we get the construction of the naturals as follows:
	1. $1:=\{\varnothing\}\in\mathbb{N}$.
	2. $\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, n\cup\{n\} \in \mathbb{N}$.
Note that here $\sigma(n)=n\cup\{n\}$, and this construction of the naturals follows Peano axioms.
