### Arrays

Single dimensional arrays are of cardinal importance, and multi-dimensionals, not so much. 
###### Declaration
Arrays  contain data of one datatype only. Therefore it is required to specify the data type in the beginning. Another thing is the length, which also needs to be declared *a priori*. 
`int arr[10];`
