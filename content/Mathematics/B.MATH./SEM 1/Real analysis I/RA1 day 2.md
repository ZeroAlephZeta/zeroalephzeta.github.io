###### Set theory
The usual business, "What is a set?" and all that. From the na√Øve set theoretic considerations arise a lot of problematic paradoxes, mostly arising from self-referential negation loops, whose cornerstone is [[Russell's paradox]]. To resolve this and more issues, Ernst Zermelo, followed by Fraenkel, came up with axioms of set theory, to formalise mathematics. Along with it came the infamous, controversial [[Axiom of Choice]] (given in class in the form of non-empty cartesian products). Since it is so non-constructive and controversial, there are quite a few branches of mathematics that do not take Choice as an axiom. But most of the mathematics in the basics is done by accepting Choice.
