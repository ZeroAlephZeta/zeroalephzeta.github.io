### Expressions
This is all about operators, constants, variables, and expressions built out of them.
There are quite a few kinds of operators:
###### Arithmetic operators
Five binary: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder, and two unary operators positive and negative. 
The binary operations take integers, floating points, etc. Some parts of the language are not defined properly; then are defined in each new case of implementations.
**Operator precedence.** Some operators take precedence over others, and there is a hierarchy. Unaries come first, and last come binary addition sand subtraction.

###### Assignment operator
